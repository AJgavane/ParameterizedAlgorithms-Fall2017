# Proof Review Exercise 1

## Getting started
Pull and compile this assignment. It's the standard homework template, so there should not be any issues. However, feel free to post in the `#latex` channel if you encounter any problems!

## Grading the proofs

The goal of this assignment is to think critically about

a. _where_ and _how_ a proof is correct or incorrect ("technical" details), and    
b. _where_ and _how_ a proof is written well or poorly ("writing" details).

Note that you need to check _both_ categories -- you cannot give up on reading a proof if it is written sloppily, you must grade it for correctness. Similarly, even if a proof is written nicely, it might contain a subtle logical flaw that you need to catch.

Provide your feedback as `graded_proof_exercise.pdf` in the `Week-4` folder.

**CSC791 students**: If a proof is wrong, you _must_ also provide a corrected proof. Please provide this as `corrected_proof_exercise.tex` in the `Week-4` folder. Note that this is a latex file, not just the PDF. You are welcome to fix the proof provided if it's a small bug, otherwise you'll need to provide an alternate solution.

## Tips
Your comments will be graded, here are some tips for getting full marks:

1. Clearly mark which category your comment is in response to. When grading your assignments I use one color for technical details, one color for writing details, and one for general remarks. I recommend you do the same!

2. Make _constructive_ remarks. If a technical detail is wrong, provide a counterexample and a lead for fixing the mistake (if possible). If writing is unclear, provide helpful tips on how it could be cleaned up (e.g. alternate phrasing).

3. Don't forget to assign a grade to each proof! It should reflect the comments you make and the rubric we provided on Slack for the Week-2 homework.

4. Big tip: At least two of the provided proofs are incorrect.
