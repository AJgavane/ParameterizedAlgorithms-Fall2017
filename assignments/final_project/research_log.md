# Final Project Research Logs

## Overview

Every Friday by 5PM you should summarize your research efforts for the week. You should note the theoretical problems you worked on and the progress (or issues!) you had, and what you contributed to writing/image creation/etc. Think of this as a chance to brag!

If you feel there is a deeper issue that Dr. Sullivan needs to look into (whether research-based or team-dynamic--based), you can also detail these in your report under some `Issues` section. Just make sure to ping Dr. Sullivan on Slack to open up this dialog.

Submit your research log as a `research_log.txt` file in your private repository under the current week's folder (see below).

## Timeline

When submitting your research logs, please put them in the `Week-X` folder of your personal repository using the following table:
