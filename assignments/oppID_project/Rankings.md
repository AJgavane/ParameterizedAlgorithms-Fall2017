# Post-Poster Session: Ranking Project Choices

Please upload a file `ranking.txt` to the `Week-9` folder in your individual GitHub repositories, where you rank the open problems you are interested in for the final project. The format should be comma-separated team numbers, where the values on one line are of equivalent interest. As an example, the following file

```
2, 4, 5
1, 9
```

says that I would love to do the project proposed by teams 2, 4 or 5, and I would be okay doing the projects by team 1 or 9. You don't need to include all projects, just the ones you are interested in. Please include at least 3 projects, though.

This assignment is due at **11:59PM on Friday, October 13**.
