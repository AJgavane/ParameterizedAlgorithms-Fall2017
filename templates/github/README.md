# Individual GitHub Template

## Setting up your repository

Please initialize your repository using the following steps:

1. You'll need to use an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Note that this is not the NC State GitHub, but the standard one. You are welcome to sign up with your NCSU email or any other email address.

2. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, git, or Markdown files, we recommend you start with the following tutorials:
 - [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
 - [GitHub cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
 - [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

3. Create a new private repository with the name `[unity ID]_PAC_2017`. Check the box to initialize this repository with a README.

4. Add a `.gitignore` file. Here you will list any file you want to exclude from your commits. Please exclude compiled files (e.g. `.log` and `.aux` files from latex compilation).

5. Create folders `Week-1` through `Week-17` and add `README.md` files to each one. These folders correspond to the weeks outlined in the syllabus (Page 5) and will be used for all individual artifacts such as weekly problem writeups, research notes, etc. In general, you should update each folder's `README.md` with any notes the TA needs to compile your latex, etc. Specific instructions on format will be provided with future assignments.

6. Once you've pushed these folders, invite the course instructor ([bdsullivan](https://github.com/bdsullivan/)) and TA ([tdgoodrich](https://github.com/tdgoodrich)) to your repository, and direct message a link to your repository to Timothy on Slack. Feel free to direct message Timothy if you have any problems or concerns along the way.

## Example

See the `tdgoodri_PAC_2017` folder example folder, where Timothy has included `Week-0` folder. Read through its README to see what a typical submission might look like.
