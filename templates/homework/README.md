# Homework Template (latex)

## Using the template
* Please start with this template. We have included some common packages (such as AMS packages for math symbols, the `graphicsx` package for images, etc.). If you see a package you are unfamiliar with, Google to see what it does!

* You may introduce more packages and/or macros as needed, but a standard homework problem should not require anything else.

* Make sure each submission is clearly labeled with a title, name, and date.

* If you have any questions or problems, post on the `#latex` Slack channel and tag the TA.

## Submitting the assignment
* For all latex assignments: **You need to push the latex source for any submission.** This will be the `.tex` file, and any images or style files that you use. Please talk to the TA immediately if you are unsure what this means.

* Please name your main latex file `homework.tex`

* The TA will compile your latex from the source, but please also include a `compiled_homework.pdf` file. This will help with manual debugging in case there are any issues.

* We do not require a `makefile` (the TA will use their own as needed), but you are welcome to include one.

* Populate your `.gitignore` file to hide any non-essential output (such as `.log`, `.aux`, `.DS_Store` on MacOS, etc.).
